First:
1-helpers.sh will install yay and aconfmgr to ~/yay

```
./1-helpers.sh
```

Then:
2-restore-system.sh will restore the system using aconfmgr.
```
./2-restore-system.sh
```

Then:

3-change-to-zsh.sh will change the shell to zsh, which should have been installed by aconfmgr.

```
./3-change-to-zsh.sh
```
